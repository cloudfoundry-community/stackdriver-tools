    ## Event Filters

    Event filters allow users to selectively enable or disable the processing of
    firehose events by the Stackdriver Nozzle. The default behaviour is to process
    all events. Events that match a blacklist filter will not be processed unless
    they also match a whitelist filter.

    A filter rule has three elements.

    *   A *regexp*, which must be a valid regular expression.
    *   A *type*, which may be either "name" or "job".
        *   *name* matches against a concatenation of event _origin_ and metric _name_
            with "." (e.g. `gorouter.total_requests`), and is only applicable for
            CounterEvent and ValueMetric event types.
        *   *job* matches against the event _job_.
    *   A *sink*, which may be either "monitoring", "logging", or "all". The latter
        applies the rule to all firehose events, while the other two restrict the
        filter rule to events destined for Stackdriver Monitoring or Logging
        respectively.

    An optional *description* field is provided for a human-readable name for each filter,
    to aid in identifying filters when the list elements are collapsed. This is ignored
    by the Stackdriver Nozzle.
